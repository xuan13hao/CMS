# Content Manager System (CMS)
A CMS helps create and manage websites and website content using minimal technical overhead, so you can make better content instead of acting as a project or traffic manager. By providing an easy and cost-effective solution for content management, a CMS allows companies to manage and distribute their content without investing in a full-time content development team. We created a small and powerful CMS to help small companies manage their websites.

# Basic Architecture 

## MVC
MVC is a design pattern where V and C are "strictly" form the presentation layer, and M can include everything that is beyond presentation (GUI).
### Model
The Model encapsulates the application data.
### View
View renders the model data and also generates HTML output that the client’s browser can interpret.
### Controller
The Controller processes the user requests and passes them to the view for rendering.

## Service
Service layer is a generic term that basically acts as an entry point to the application domain and typically includes business logic. For a web application, you could treat the business logic layer as a service layer, or for mobile clients, you could expose a web API and treat is a service layer. In short irrespective of GUI/ Client, you should be able to re-use business logic as-is.

## DAOs 
DAOs are just the objects that abstract away the data storage mechanism.
